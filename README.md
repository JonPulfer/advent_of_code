# Advent of code 2018

[Puzzle source](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

I've been leisurely working through the recent advent of code using Rust to solve the puzzles. This repos is just
to record that learning and research and provide me with a reference for later. I haven't included the puzzle text 
here since I feel it is better to refer back to the source for any context as it might encourage people to support 
the advent of code in future.
